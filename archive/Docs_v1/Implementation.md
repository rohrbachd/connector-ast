# Implementation Plan for connector-ast

## Feature Analysis
### Identified Features:
1. **DSP Control Plane** – Implement catalog, contract negotiation, transfer management, and self-descriptions for datasets and services.
2. **Trust & Identity Integration** – Verify wallet-presented credentials (OID4VP/OID4VCI) and map roles into authorization context.
3. **ODRL-based Contracts** – Parse and enforce ODRL policies, handle constraints, and execute obligations via data-plane guards.
4. **Services as First-Class Assets** – Support service offers with descriptors and invocation tokens bound to agreements.
5. **Semantic Metadata & Validation** – Use JSON-LD/DCAT-AP/NGSI-LD metadata with SHACL validation and profile-based content negotiation.
6. **Observability & Audit** – Emit contract and transfer telemetry, export activity records, and enforce privacy controls.
7. **Compatibility & Interoperability** – Pass DSP TCK and integrate with Gaia-X credentials.
8. **Data Plane Gateway & Adapters** – Execute transfers with enforcement, supporting HTTP, S3/Blob, WebDAV, NFS, MQTT, Kafka, and compute-to-data calls.
9. **Guards/Proxies for Obligations** – Provide inline enforcement for duties such as deletion, notification, watermarking, geo-fencing, and usage limits.
10. **Persistence Layer** – Store metadata in document or triple stores and maintain append-only agreement logs with hash-chain receipts.
11. **Deployment Footprints** – Support single-node edge deployments, standard CP/DP pods, and scale-out topologies.

### Feature Categorization:
