# UI/UX Overview

The connector ships with a lightweight web dashboard for developers and operators. Key design guidelines:

- **Simplicity:** Provide a clean layout for publishing offers, managing policies, and monitoring transfers.
- **Consistency:** Use React components with a unified design system to ensure a coherent experience.
- **Accessibility:** Follow WCAG guidelines; ensure keyboard navigation and high contrast.
- **Responsive Design:** Optimize for desktop first, while maintaining usability on tablets.
- **Feedback:** Surface validation errors and success states prominently, using toast notifications and inline messages.

The dashboard complements CLI tooling and is optional for headless deployments.
