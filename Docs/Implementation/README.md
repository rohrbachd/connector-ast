2. **Development Process**: [`../Operations/workflow.md`](../Operations/workflow.md) - Step-by-step workflow
3. **Current Stage**: Check implementation-summary.md for current development stage
4. **Coding Standards**: [`coding-rules.md`](coding-rules.md) - Development guidelines
5. **Run & Test**: [`connector-setup-testing.md`](connector-setup-testing.md) - Local and Docker usage guide

## ðŸš€ AI Agent Workflow

For AI agents working on this project:

1. **Read** [`implementation-summary.md`](implementation-summary.md) to understand the complete project scope
2. **Check** current implementation stage and available tasks
3. **Follow** [`../Operations/workflow.md`](../Operations/workflow.md) for step-by-step development process
4. **Reference** architecture documents for technical decisions
5. **Apply** coding standards from [`coding-rules.md`](coding-rules.md)
6. **Create branches** for each subtask as specified in workflow
7. **Submit merge requests** following the established process

## ðŸ“Š Implementation Progress Tracking

The implementation follows a 4-stage approach with clear milestones:

- Each stage has specific deliverables and acceptance criteria
- Progress is tracked through the implementation-summary document
- All tasks are designed for branch-based development with merge requests

## ðŸ”„ Document Maintenance

- Implementation documents are updated as development progresses
- Cross-references are maintained between related documents
- All links use relative paths for portability
- Regular validation ensures accuracy of references
