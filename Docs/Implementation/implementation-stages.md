# Implementation Stages - Lightweight Dataspace Connector

## Implementation Strategy Overview

Based on the **phased MVP approach**, the implementation is divided into 4 main stages:

1. **Stage 1: Foundation & Core DSP** - Basic DSP protocol implementation
2. **Stage 2: Trust & Identity** - Verifiable credentials and DID resolution
3. **Stage 3: Data Plane & Adapters** - Transport adapters and policy enforcement
4. **Stage 4: Advanced Features & Production** - Real-time features, optimization, and deployment

Each stage builds upon the previous one, ensuring working functionality at each milestone.

## Cross-Cutting Implementation Considerations

### Development Practices

#### Code Quality
- **Test-Driven Development:** Write tests before implementation for complex logic
- **Code Reviews:** All code must be reviewed by at least one other developer
- **Static Analysis:** Use ESLint, TypeScript strict mode, and SonarQube
- **Documentation:** JSDoc for all public APIs, README for each package

#### Version Control
- **Git Flow:** Feature branches, pull requests, protected main branch
- **Semantic Versioning:** Follow semver for all packages
- **Conventional Commits:** Use conventional commit messages
- **Release Notes:** Automated generation from commit messages

#### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests:** >80% code coverage for business logic
- **Integration Tests:** Test component interactions
- **End-to-End Tests:** Test complete user workflows
- **Performance Tests:** Automated performance regression testing

### Risk Mitigation

#### Technical Risks
- **Complexity Risk:** Break down complex features into smaller tasks
- **Integration Risk:** Early integration testing with mock services
- **Performance Risk:** Performance testing from Stage 1
- **Security Risk:** Security review at each stage gate

#### Schedule Risks
- **Dependency Risk:** Parallel development where possible
- **Resource Risk:** Cross-training team members
- **Scope Risk:** Clear acceptance criteria and change control
- **Quality Risk:** Automated testing and continuous integration

### Success Metrics

#### Stage 1 Success Criteria
- Basic DSP endpoints functional
- Can negotiate simple contracts
- Database and caching working
- CI/CD pipeline operational

#### Stage 2 Success Criteria
- VC verification working with real wallets

- Semantic catalog with federation
- Complete DSP workflow end-to-end

#### Stage 4 Success Criteria

This phased approach ensures working functionality at each stage while building toward a complete, production-ready dataspace connector that meets all PRD requirements.
