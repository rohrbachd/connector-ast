## Document Organization Principles

1. **Implementation-First**: The Implementation folder serves as the primary entry point for development work
2. **Clear References**: Each document cross-references related documents with clickable links
3. **AI Agent Friendly**: Structure designed for systematic AI agent navigation and task execution
4. **Comprehensive Coverage**: All aspects from planning to deployment are documented
5. **Maintainable**: Regular updates and validation of cross-references

## Getting Started

1. **For Development Tasks**: Start with [`Implementation/implementation-summary.md`](Implementation/implementation-summary.md)
2. **For Architecture Understanding**: Review [`Architecture/system-architecture.md`](Architecture/system-architecture.md)
3. **For Setup**: Follow [`Operations/development-environment-setup.md`](Operations/development-environment-setup.md)
4. **For Workflow**: Use [`Operations/workflow.md`](Operations/workflow.md) for step-by-step guidance

## Maintenance

- All internal links use relative paths for portability
- Each subfolder contains a README.md for navigation
- Cross-references are validated regularly
- Documents are updated as implementation progresses
