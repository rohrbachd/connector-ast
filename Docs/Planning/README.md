# Planning Documentation

This folder contains all planning and requirements documentation for the Lightweight Dataspace Connector project.

## ðŸ“‹ Planning Overview

The planning documentation provides the foundation for all implementation work, including product requirements, technology decisions, and project generation guidelines.

## ðŸ“„ Core Planning Documents

### Product Requirements
- **[`PRD.md`](PRD.md)** - Complete Product Requirements Document
  - Executive summary and core principles
  - Functional requirements by domain
  - Non-functional requirements and performance targets
  - API surface definitions
  - Extension model and SDK specifications
  - Compliance and certification requirements
  - End-to-end workflow examples

### Technology Analysis
- **[`tech-stack-analysis.md`](tech-stack-analysis.md)** - Comprehensive technology stack analysis
  - Core technology selections with rationale
  - Node.js 20 LTS + TypeScript 5.3+ runtime
  - Fastify 4.x framework for high performance
  - PostgreSQL 15+ with Prisma ORM
  - Redis 7+ for caching and sessions
  - Security libraries (jose, Veramo)
  - Observability stack (OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, Grafana)

### Project Generation Guidelines
- **[`generate.md`](generate.md)** - Project generation rules and templates
  - PRD analysis workflow
  - Feature identification methodology
  - Technology stack research requirements
  - Implementation staging approach
  - Documentation structure requirements
  - Output format specifications

## ðŸŽ¯ Planning Principles

### 1. **Standards-First Approach**
- DSP protocol conformance
- W3C VC 2.0 and OID4VP integration
- Gaia-X Trust Framework alignment
- ODRL policy model implementation

### 2. **Phased Delivery Strategy**
- 4-stage implementation approach
- Working functionality at each milestone
- Risk mitigation through incremental delivery
- Early feedback incorporation

### 3. **Production Readiness**
- Comprehensive observability from day one
- Security-first architecture
- Scalable deployment patterns
- Performance targets and monitoring

### 4. **Developer Experience**
- Type-safe development with TypeScript
- Comprehensive testing strategy
- Clear documentation and examples
- One-command development setup

## ðŸ”— Planning Context

### Requirements Traceability
The planning documents establish clear traceability:
- **PRD** â†’ **Feature Analysis** â†’ **Implementation Stages** â†’ **Architecture Design**
- Each requirement maps to specific implementation tasks
- Acceptance criteria defined for all major features
- Compliance requirements linked to implementation details

### Technology Decisions
Technology choices are driven by:
- **Performance Requirements**: Sub-150ms CP response times, â‰¥2 Gbps DP throughput
- **Scalability Needs**: Horizontal scaling, stateless CP design
- **Security Requirements**: Zero-trust architecture, comprehensive audit logging
- **Developer Productivity**: Type safety, hot reload, comprehensive tooling

## ðŸ“Š Planning Validation

The planning is validated through:
- **Stakeholder Review**: Requirements validation with domain experts
- **Technical Feasibility**: Architecture proof-of-concept validation
- **Market Analysis**: Competitive analysis and standards alignment
- **Risk Assessment**: Technical and business risk evaluation

## ðŸ”„ Planning Evolution

Planning documents are living documents that evolve:
- **Regular Reviews**: Quarterly planning review cycles
- **Feedback Integration**: User feedback and market changes
- **Technical Updates**: New standards and technology developments
- **Scope Adjustments**: Based on implementation learnings
