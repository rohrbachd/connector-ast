# Architecture Documentation

This folder contains all architectural design documents for the Lightweight Dataspace Connector.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The Lightweight Dataspace Connector follows a **strict Control Plane (CP) / Data Plane (DP) separation** with event-driven architecture and plugin-based extensibility.

## üìê Core Architecture Documents

### System Design
- **[`system-architecture.md`](system-architecture.md)** - Complete system architecture
  - CP/DP separation and communication patterns
  - Event-driven architecture with internal message bus
  - Plugin architecture for adapters and executors
  - Stateless Control Plane design for horizontal scaling
  - Policy-based access control with ODRL enforcement

### Security Architecture
- **[`security-architecture.md`](security-architecture.md)** - Comprehensive security design

## üîó Architecture Principles

### 1. **Strict CP/DP Separation**
- Independent scaling and deployment
- Clear responsibility boundaries
- Secure communication channels

### 2. **Event-Driven Architecture**
- Internal message bus for component communication
- Asynchronous processing capabilities
- Observability through event streams

### 3. **Plugin Architecture**
- Extensible transport adapters
- Pluggable duty executors
- Configurable identity providers
- Industry-specific semantic extensions

### 4. **Policy-Based Access Control**
- ODRL policy enforcement
- Fine-grained authorization
- Runtime policy evaluation

### 5. **Standards Compliance**
- DSP protocol conformance
- W3C VC 2.0 and OID4VP support
- Gaia-X credential integration
- IDSA alignment

## üîÑ Architecture Evolution

The architecture supports phased implementation:

1. **Stage 1**: Foundation with basic CP/DP structure
2. **Stage 2**: Trust and identity integration
3. **Stage 3**: Full data plane with adapters
4. **Stage 4**: Advanced features and production readiness

## üéØ For Developers

When implementing features:
1. **Review** relevant architecture documents first
2. **Follow** established patterns and principles
3. **Maintain** CP/DP separation
4. **Implement** proper error handling and observability
5. **Test** integration points thoroughly
6. **Document** any architectural changes or extensions

## üìã Architecture Validation

The architecture is validated through:
- **Conformance Testing**: DSP TCK compliance
- **Integration Testing**: Multi-connector interoperability
- **Performance Testing**: Scalability and throughput validation
- **Security Testing**: Penetration testing and vulnerability assessment
