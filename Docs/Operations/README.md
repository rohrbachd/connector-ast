### Development Environment

- **[`development-environment-setup.md`](development-environment-setup.md)** - Complete development setup
  - One-command setup with `pnpm run setup:dev`
  - Hot reload with TypeScript watch mode
  - VS Code configuration and debugging setup
  - Docker development environment
  - Testing framework setup (Vitest + Playwright)
  - Comprehensive tooling configuration

### Deployment Strategy

- **[`deployment-devops-strategy.md`](deployment-devops-strategy.md)** - Production deployment guidance
  - Multiple deployment modes (Standard Cloud, Edge, Scale-out)
  - Container strategy with multi-stage Docker builds
  - Kubernetes deployment with Helm charts
  - CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
  - Infrastructure as Code with Terraform
  - Monitoring and observability setup

## üöÄ Deployment Modes

### 1. **Standard Cloud (Primary)**

- Separate CP/DP pods with external databases
- Horizontal scaling with auto-scaling policies
- Multi-zone deployment for high availability
- External PostgreSQL and Redis services

### 2. **Edge/On-premises**

- Single-node deployment with embedded components
- Minimal resource footprint (<300MB RAM)
- Local database with backup strategies
- Offline-capable operation

### 3. **Scale-out**

- Horizontal scaling with multi-zone deployment
- Separate adapter and PDP scaling
- Advanced load balancing and traffic management
- Enterprise-grade monitoring and alerting

## üîÑ Development Workflow

### AI Agent Workflow Process

1. **Task Assessment** - Read from Implementation documentation
2. **Branch Creation** - Feature branches for all changes
3. **Documentation Research** - Reference architecture and planning docs
4. **Implementation** - Follow coding standards and testing requirements
5. **Pull Request Creation** - Comprehensive PR templates
6. **Self-Review Process** - Thorough quality validation
7. **Merge and Cleanup** - Clean history with branch deletion
8. **Post-Merge Verification** - Validate main branch functionality

### Branch Management

- **Feature branches**: `feature/stage#-brief-description`
- **Bug fixes**: `bugfix/bug#-brief-description`
- **Hotfixes**: `hotfix/critical-issue`
- **Documentation**: `docs/specific-doc-update`
