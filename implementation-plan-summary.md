# Implementation Plan Summary - Lightweight Dataspace Connector

## Overview

This comprehensive implementation plan provides a complete roadmap for building a **Lightweight Dataspace Connector** that implements the Dataspace Protocol (DSP) with TypeScript for both Control Plane (CP) and Data Plane (DP). The plan follows a **phased MVP approach** targeting **standard cloud deployment** as the primary deployment mode.
